Started to explore the NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Dataset, with an aim to develop some intuition regarding it, try to figure out parameters and gain deeper insights and some preliminary ideas about preprocessing.

Learnings

Read the original paper regarding the dataset, to get better acquainted with the research methodology and understand the parameters used with a focus on why and how it contributes to the dataset and how it can be helpful to understand the Remaining Useful Life(RUL). The intention being a deeper understanding of these parameters would be valuable in making informed choices regarding preprocessing and model selection.

Challenges faced

Paper was quite technical, had to constantly refer other sources and search the net for an expanded detailed understanding of the subject.
